# ASSESSMENT 3: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is JSX? What is one syntax difference between HTML and JSX?

Your answer: JSX is a markdown syntax extension of Javascript within react that acts similiar to HTML. A difference between them is that in order to modify the look and behavior of a JSX  through CSS, it uses className rather than the HTML class that would be used to modify.

Researched answer: JSX is a Javacascript markdown language that allows HTML to be written in React. It allows developers to apply HTML elements in javascript that can display information and behaviors in the Document Object Model or DOM for short and what that does it allows information to be rendered in a web browser. One difference is the way class is classified in JSX. Class is an attribute that HTML uses to create a specific task or modification. Class in JSX is given or written as className.

2. What is yarn? What file(s) are modified in a React application when you run yarn?

Your answer: yarn is a javascript package manager that was created by Facebook to manage node modules. yarn can create the file structer used to create a react application. Of those files the files that are mostly modified would be the files found in the SRC folder specifically the App.js and the component files. 

Researched answer: Yarn is the Javascript package manager used to manage dependencies files. It was originally created by Facebook to resolve issues with the NPM package manager. Yarn contains a command that creates the nessesary file structures that are need to create a react application. inside a react application contains HTML, CSS, MD, JS and component files with default setting of codes that we can modify to build a application from scratch.           

3. What is an anonymous function in JavaScript?

Your answer: an anonymous function is a function that does not have a direct name associated with it and cannot be accessed after it is created. An example of an anonymous function would be the function within a high order function.
Researched answer: an anonymous function is a function that is associated with a variable but no name identifier whereas a normal function contains a name identifie. anonymous functions are use as arguments to other functions as well as creating function expressions.

4. What is the difference between  a class and an object?

Your answer: A difference between a class and an object is that a class is considered to be the blueprint of objects meaning it is use to declare and create objects. it also uses particular keywords to create and access information whereas an object can be an instance of a class and is a physical entity rather than a logical entity

Researched answer: The difference is that class is a data type that can declare and create object whereas an object is a instance of a class. Class is by definition a function that can contain data and behavior and use particula keywords such constructors, this. and new. Objects is not a function but can contain a function as an object and is physical entity whereas class is a logical entity.

5. What is the difference between state and props in React?

Your answer: state is a unique variable that makes a component dynamic by storeing an intial data value that changes with user interactions within a react application whereas props are a special react objects specifically used to pass information from a parent component to a nested component by the component invocation. props do not change in date as states. they can be either static or methods.

Researched answer: states are variables that are used in react to pass data to components to perform logic to create an interaction. when building a component we creat a method with no data to execute an interaction and state is a react hook that allows developers to start an initial value and uses a method to make a component dynamic. Props are react objects specifically used to pass information from a parent component down to a nested component through the component invocation, however props are not dynamic and is a parameter to JSX. It can be static or a method but it does not track or update data like states. 

6. STRETCH: Which is the difference between a div and a span?

Your answer: div is used to group large peices of  block level data to be rendered and displayed wheareas span is used for inline level.

Researched answer: span is used for organization and styleing for inline level elements. inline level elements are elements that do not start a new line and takes as much space as needed in a page. Div is for o block level elements to divide content into blocks. It starts a new line and can have the width of the whole web browser page and its container.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Object-oriented programming: OOP is a program style 
that was created to deal with software as it it grew and became complex. Programming would become difficult to maintain and would disrupt the whole system with errors if one small change occurred. Developers needed a solution to create containers so that data could be changed and manipulated without causing a ripple affect.
2. Ruby: ruby is a object oriented programming language that stores data and behavior.

3. Implicit return: Implicit returns is a function that does not use the keyword return to return values. when using objects with implicit return, they need to be wrapped in paranthesis so the curly braces can be seperated from the opening functions body.

4. Ruby blocks: blocks are similiar to the anonymous functions in javascript. They do not require a name for the method and can pass as a method call. the can be created with do/end keywords or curly braces {}. 

5. Ruby hashes: A ruby hash is container that stores data. Its syntax structure contains a name followed by a equal sign following curly braces. Inside the curly brace contains data of key value pairs.
